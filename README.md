# TensorFlow to TMVA Adapter
The TensorFlow to TMVA Adapter aims to replicate the functionality of ROOT's TMVA Python API using TensorFlow. This gives us the opportunity to make use of TensorFlow's flexible architecture to run the statistical analysis typically reserved for TMVA, with minimal changes to existing code.
